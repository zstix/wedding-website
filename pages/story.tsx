      <h1>Story</h1>
      <p>
        It was a dark and stormy night, when Nina and Zack met…. Actually, it
        was a fun and lively trivia night at a biergarten in Boulder. Mutual
        friends had gathered a big group of people and we ended up sitting next
        to each other. Nina remembers Zack telling her about his go-to fake name
        when putting in orders at restaurants (Alex) and Zack remembers how much
        more fun he was having talking to Nina than playing trivia.

      <h2>First Date</h2>
      <p>
        Nina and Zack had their first date four years (to the day) before their
        wedding date. Nina was recovering from vision correction surgery and
        could only see vague, blurry shapes. After Zack figured out that she
        wasn’t ignoring his initial wave of greeting and was still pleased to
        “see” him, it flowed effortlessly. They enjoyed cocktails around
        Boulder, talked until irresponsibly late on a Monday night, and then
        Nina fell asleep during a late-night Disney movie (a oft-repeated
        occurence.) Nina’s timid cat, Mycroft, also took an immediate liking to
        Zack and formed a bond that continues to this day and only makes Nina a
        little bit jealous. It was effortless, comfortable, and engaging. They
        both knew that this rapport was something special.

      <h2>Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        In the time that they’ve been together, Zack and Nina have lived in
        Boulder, CO; Nashville, TN; and now Portland, OR. They’ve traveled
        internationally to Belize, Mexico (where he proposed), and England.

      <h2>The Wedding Party</h2>

      <h3>Jess Pezley</h3>
      <p>
        Nina and Jess met on a drive through the Rocky Mountains to look at the
        changing leaves. That day, a spontaneous competition to see who could
        swing higher on a swing-set made it clear to Nina that she’d found a
        friend who would be something special. In Jess, Nina found an inspiring,
        passionate, witty, generous best friend with whom she still talks with
        ~3-5 times a day. Jess and Nina have remained close through many moves
        across the country for schools and jobs.

      <h3>Erinn Kary</h3>

      <h3>Molly Nogami</h3>
      <p>
        On the first day of high school, the biology teacher walked up to Nina
        and then pushed her until she was chest-to-chest with another girl,
        saying “you two look nervous. You should be friends.” That person was
        Molly and, indeed, they were friends and have remained so for the last
        16 years. Molly knows Nina better than almost anyone in the world and
        has been the most consistent, positive support that anyone could ever
        want.
